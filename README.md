# Fire_spread

The project aims to develop an algorithm for fire detection using a combination of a Long Short-term
Memory (LSTM) recurring neural network (NN) based image detection and a support vector machine
(SVM) based fire detection based on a set of data measured by the deployed sensor nodes, followed
by an extensive LSTM based fire spread prediction based on the measured dataset. The resulting
output consists of the directions and rates of spread.
